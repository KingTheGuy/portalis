Who, me?:
This plugin adds warping/teleporting in a more gameplay oriented way. Craft the item, refill it, warp here, there, refill it.. warp again. Maybe grind a bit and craft a few lodestones..

I know we don't all have the time to spend walking around, but im also not a fan of slash commands.. if you feel the same i hope this plugin can help with that.

*also adds a really cool dial-menu that i may release as an independent plugin.*

The Portalis:

The Portalis(a magical book) gives the user the ability to warp back to their bed, spawn, other user, lodestones, and even their last-death.
note: it requires Infused-paper to function. oh, also.. you keep it on death.

Ok but why?:
[DUSTY](https://dustyhub.net) a server that i run needed an easier way for players to get around, you know most people just don't have the time to spend walking around. Most other TP plugins require the player to do slash commands, which just takes the player away from the game. So an answer to that was for me to create this plugin.

The cauldron didn't really do much, so i gave it some new mechanics.
Use this ?new? mechanic to create Infused-paper.
