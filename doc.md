### warping to other book users

to warp to other users you'll
have to ask them select
`wait_for` within the book's
menu.

while they wait you need to
select `warp_to`. if all is
done correctly they plyer you
want to warp_to should appear
as an option.

warping to user will consume a
page from the requesting user.

and toss in the ingredients.

### Custom warp locations

#### Creating

Placing down a lodestone crouch
clicking it with a Portalis will
create a location for the user to
warp to.

#### Saving location

if you happen to find an
active lodestone and would
like to save it for yourself
you can use your book on it,
saving its location.

#### Using

Stepping on any active
lodestone will open a warp
menu showing you all other
locations that you have
saved. Warping from lodestone
to lodestone will cost you
nothing.
